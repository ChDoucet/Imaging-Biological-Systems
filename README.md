# UE Imaging Biological Systems 2022-2023

[TOC]

## OVERVIEW

See [here](UE_short_overview/Intro_BioImaging_2022.pptx.pdf) for the slides introducing the UE.

The UE Imaging Biological Systems is organized around three sections with increasing levels of complexity:

​	In section I. the students will be taught the good practices when handling potentially hazardous or fragile instruments and will learn how to align optics and characterize them. 

​	In section II. they will design and build an imaging setup (among which a TIRF, a confocal or an AFM). Then they will use it to run simple experiments.

​	In section III. the students will use advanced microscopes used routinely by researchers at CBS. They will design the experiment, participate in the sample preparation and then run the experiment and analyse the data.

| Sections | Hours | Evaluations | Teachers | Description |
| ------------ |----| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| I. Basics | 5h CM + 4h TP = 9 hours** | None |         | Safety & Good practices |
| II. Build a setup | 4h TD + 12h TP = **16 hours** | Written report + oral restitution |         | TIRF/Confocal/AFM |
| III. Practicals | 5h TD + ~2x5h TP = **15 hours** | Written report + oral restitution |         | SMLM/FCS/AFM |

**<u>Homeworks</u>**: 

* Prepare the TD : [Optics basics tutorials](Tutorials_Optics_basics/Tutorials_Optics_basics.pdf) BEFORE the session!
* For the rest : None! Just come as you are :-). For the practicals of [Optics basics](Pratical_Optics_basics/TP_optics_basics.pdf) you might want to define binomes (+1 trinome if you are an odd number) before the session.

### Section #2-Build a setup
| Date | Schedule | Subject | Location | Instructors|
| ------------ |----| ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| 26/10/22 |14:00-16:00| TD : Intro to [building your setup](Build_your_setup/Build_your_setup.pdf) | Bungalow/Conference room/Meeting room | ALG, EM, LC |
| 09/11/22 |14:00-16:00| TD : Troubleshooting| qBio/Confocal/AFM | ALG, EM, LC  |
| 18/11/22 |14:00-17:00| TP : [Building your setup](Build_your_setup/Build_your_setup.pdf) | qBio/Confocal/AFM | ALG, EM, LC  |

| 30/11/22 |14:00-17:00| Oral restitutions #1| Conference room | ALG, EM, LC, CD  |

**<u>Homeworks</u>**: 

* Pick the setup you want to build among the [three setups](Build_your_setup/Build_your_setup.pdf) (2 students per setup for the confocal and AFM and 3 students for the TIRF)
* During the "TD : Intro to [building your setup](Build_your_setup/Build_your_setup.pdf)'' you will design the setup with the teacher, however it is highly recommended that you think about the design before the session.
* During the "TD : Troubleshooting" you will validate the last details of the design. You should have a well thought design BEFORE the session.
* During the TP you will take notes and acquire data that you may need to process/analyse for the written report and the oral restitutions.
* During the last practical session of 23/11/22 each group will present their setup (explain and guide the others to use their setup and run an acquisition) and give a demo to other students. Students will be encouraged to ask questions.
* Written report guidelines:
  * introduction of the technique, justify the design (with your calculations!), description of the building process + troubleshooting, proof of concept experiment, conclusion + discussion
  * It is strongly advised that you start writing the report as soon as you start reflecting on the setup design!
  * Written report restitution deadline : **==28/11/2022==**
* Oral restitutions guidelines:
  * 10 minutes (12 minutes for the trinome) of presentation by each binome/trinome
  * 20 minutes of questions by the students and teachers.
  * Oral restitution  : **==30/11/2022==**
